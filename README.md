# MBRWSpectralDimension
As part of my dissertation, I am investigating the value of spectral dimension as a measure of network complexity. In addition to conventional spectral dimension, our lab has developed a spectral dimension based on a memory-biased random walk as opposed to a simple random walk and a measure of multi-spectrality analogous to existing measures of multi-fractality.
